# Deno Solutions

List of solutions using the [Deno](https://deno.land/) runtime.
Any [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and especially,
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) based solutions will run in Deno.
This is due to a built in standard library,
testing suite,
and Deno being more attuned to scripting without the needs of a package.json file.
